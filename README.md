# Profile Website 

A website for storing all my projects that I feel are worthy with being shared. If you have any ideas of how to improve this website or any of my projects, please send a private message. I want to add a proper form to the email section once I learn how to make it immune to spam, and when I'm not more concerned with building new projects. I've been thinking of adding one of those buttons that act as an anchor link, but I feel like the splash page does a good enough job. Most people aren't braindead and can use a scroll wheel.
